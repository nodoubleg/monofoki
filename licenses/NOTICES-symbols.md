# Additional terminal symbol outlines

Monofoki incorporates only the Unicode glyphs listed in
`script_helper/symbol_additions.json`, with identical upright symbol outlines in
all four styles. Existing Monofoki outlines remain unchanged outside Braille.
The font inputs, URLs and SHA-256 digests are pinned in
`script_helper/build_dependencies.json`. Donor binaries are downloaded build
inputs; they are not checked into this repository.

Their font names are not used as Monofoki's font name. Glyph provenance records
the original code point and geometric transformation for every addition.
Semigraphics fit the complete terminal cell; other symbols keep their aspect
ratio and fit within side bearings. No unrelated private-use icon substitutes
for a Unicode character.

U+2B96 EQUALS SIGN WITH INFINITY ABOVE is derived by reflecting Noto's
U+2BF9 EQUALS SIGN WITH INFINITY BELOW vertically. Its two components retain
their form with their order reversed. This and the three Kreative glyphs were
compared visually with the rendered Unicode 18 reference charts:
[Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2B00.pdf)
and [Symbols for Legacy Computing](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1FB00.pdf).

The Braille sources match Nerd Fonts 3.5.1's default 0.6-ratio rectangle grid;
the Nerd Font build uses its actual Braille generator. Unicode assignment,
name, width and emoji-variation data are the final Unicode 18.0.0 UCD files
from <https://www.unicode.org/Public/18.0.0/ucd/>. See `LICENSE-Unicode`.
